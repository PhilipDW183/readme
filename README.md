Everything you need to know about UCL DSS workshops!

## About

Welcome to the UCL Data Science Society âœ¨ ! This is a quick starter pack for a _Science_ executive and anyone else who is involved in the planning, design, scheduling, implementation and maintenance of the workshops.

## Acknowledgements

Big shout out to @oleksiysmola Alex for implementing more than ten amazing workshops last year as the Head of _Science_ and continuing to contribute to the work at _Science_ this year. Without his legacy workshop materials, we would never be able to achieve what we have today. Thanks, Alex!

## Workshops Available

This year, we have catagorised our workshops into **three** main themes:

- Data Science with Python ðŸ”®
- Toolkits for Data Scientists ðŸ”¬

## Contributing to Workshops

In order to maintain the consistency and quality of our workshops, please follow these rules throughout your implementations.

### Format

A recommended format for Python programming related workshops is _Jupyter Notebooks_. Other formats include Markdown, PDF, PowerPoint and so on. The following are some guidelines to follow.

#### _Jupyter Notebooks_

- Title: `<Code> - <Theme>:<Topic>`, e.g. `PY01 - Introduction to Python Programming:Fundamentals`
- Use clear sub-title structure throughout the notebooks (`h1`to `h6` in _Markdown_ syntax)
- Use _Markdown_ syntax throughtout the notebooks: e.g. *italic*, **bold**, ***bold and italic***, _Object_,`inlineCode()`, quoteblocks and codeblocks and so on. This document is an example.
- Keep a consistency. For instance, I prefer to use a quoteblock for definition:
    > ***Computer Science***:
    > The study of computation and information. Computer science deals with theory of computation, algorithms, computational problems, and the design of computer systems hardware, software, and applications.

- Use _LaTeX_ for mathematical formulae and expressions, both inline and equation blocks.
- Use relative path instead of absolute path for inserting pictures, if there is any. Put pictures in `assets/`
- Remove the answers from the questions and exercises, or put them in to different codeblocks to reserve spaces for attempting

#### _Markdown_

All of above, and:

- If possible, export a PDF version using [_Typora_](http://typora.io) with theme `Ursine Umbrella`

#### PowerPoint

- Use DSS logo on every page.

### Structure
Alex's legacy workshops had set a plausible structure for workshops. Example would be:

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ some-workshop
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workshop.ipynb
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem.ipynb
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ answer.ipynb
    â””â”€â”€ assets
        â””â”€â”€ figure1.png
```

- `workshop`: the workshop material in `.ipynb`, `.pdf`, `.md`, `.ppt` and so on
- `problem`: exercises with no answers on it
- `answer`: answers to `problem`
- `README`: a syllabus of the course
- `assets/`: where you put the pictures and attachments to

#### README

The README should have:

- Title
- Description
- Prerequisite (use workshop `code` if possible)
- Author and How to Contact Author
- Objectives and Outcome
- Outline (just copy and paste the title structure from `h1` to `h6` in your workshop in a tree structure)

## Project Management at _Science_

The _kanbans_ are used for project management:

- [Data Science with Python Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/UCL-DSS/projects/3)
- [Toolkits for Data Scientists Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/UCL-DSS/projects/4)
- [Introduction to Python Programming Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/UCL-DSS/projects/5)

Create an `issue` in each repository to represent a TODO. The `issues` will be added to the Kanban as a card with a person assigned to it. Label the cards well. `Close` the `issue` when finished.

### Workflow

1. Create a repository with `UCL-DSS` account, the name of thye repository should be `<keyword>-workshop` (e.g. `python-logic-workshop`)
2. `Fork` the repository to your own warehouse. Maintain your own repository.
    > Keep commits small and use multiple commits. E.g. `Commit#1: Write introduction` `Commit#2: Update question 1` instead of `Commit#1: Implement workshop 1`

3. Create `issue` for TODOs. Keep comments and communications on the issues to that issue thread. Keep track of the kanbans to ensure your tasks are managed.
4. Make a `pull request` to the `main` branch of the `UCL-DSS` repository when finished. `Link` that pull request to the issues related. I will `merge` it and `close` the issues manually.

## Scheduling of Workshops

Since this academic year the lectures are mostly pre-recorded, so Monday to Wednesday should be a good fit to students' schedule. Each week, I will issue a ticket to the relavent executives and FYR with a workshop to do. The executive will contact _Marketing_ and provide your marketing information. Usually, that includes:

- Your name
- Your picture
- Theme
- Code
- Title
- Prerequisite
- Difficulty (1~5)
- GitHub repository link
- Preparation needed
- Time and Date using London Time - you decide on which day (Mon ~ Wed) and exact time to host the workshop. With consideration for people in UTC+1/+0 to UTC+8

> All workshops are hosted using our MS Teams channel and will be recorded. Most of the information can be found above.

## Collaboration with Imperial College
