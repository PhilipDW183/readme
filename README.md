Everything you need to know about UCL DSS workshops!

## About

Welcome to the UCL Data Science Society âœ¨ ! This is a quick starter pack for a _Science_ executive and anyone else who is involved in the planning, design, scheduling, implementation and maintenance of the workshops.

## Acknowledgements

Big shout out to @oleksiysmola Alex for implementing more than ten amazing workshops last year as the Head of _Science_ and continuing to contribute to the work at _Science_ this year. Without his legacy workshop materials, we would never be able to achieve what we have today. Thanks, Alex!

## Workshops Available

This year, we have catagorised our workshops into **three** main themes:

- Data Science with Python ðŸ”®
- Toolkits for Data Scientists ðŸ”¬
- Introduction to Python Programming ðŸ’»

> Legend:
> - ðŸŸ¥: Not implemented
> - ðŸŸ¨: Legacy material available, to be updated
> - ðŸŸ¦: Available, modification required
> - ðŸŸ©: Good to go
